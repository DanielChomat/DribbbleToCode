# Welcome to Dribbble To Code

My name is Daniel, a junior web developer, coder and designer(maybe on that last one).
I have decided to start on a project in which I am going to be recreating some website designs from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) to learn and progress in coding, website design and UX in general. 
Basically to converting PSDs to HTML and CSS.

This project is mainly meant to be used as part of my portfolio for participation in my next employment/projects.

Occasionally, I will be putting here projects, I've been working on outside of Dribbble.

## [Craftwork Market | reDesign](https://dribbble.com/shots/6298606-Craftwork-Market-reDesign)

This is the first Dribbble I have decided to work on. It is pretty basic, but very nicely done.

I have finally got an opportunity to practice my CSS Grid knowledge. This technology is awesome, and therefore may be overused in this project.

### Main keys not implemented (TO-DO)

- Not responsive for all screen sizes
- CSS Grid is not optimized for IE 10/11
