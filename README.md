# Welcome to Dribbble To Code

I am Daniel, a junior web developer, coder and designer(a maybe on that last one) from :czech_republic:.

I have decided to start a project in which I am going to be recreating some website designs from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) to _learn_ and _progress_ in **coding**, **website design** and **UX** in general. 

Basically to converting `PSDs` to `HTML` and `CSS`. Every project will be written in `SCSS` comprised of multiple files and imported into a single one. 

Then the code will be processed with _[node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)_ into a single `CSS` file linked in `HTML` files. Occassional JavaScript will appear (hopefully more and more, as it is the main course I would like to be heading)

This project is mainly meant to be used for getting better at website development as well as part of my portfolio for participation in my next employment/projects.

Occasionally, I will be putting here projects, I've been working on outside of Dribbble.

> I am open to any suggestions / questions reagarding my code! Just slide into my DMs on Instagram [@DribbbleToCode](https://instagram.com/DribbbleToCode)! 

## [1. Craftwork Market | reDesign](https://dribbble.com/shots/6298606-Craftwork-Market-reDesign)

This is the first Dribbble I have decided to work on. It is pretty basic, but very nicely done.

I have finally got an opportunity to practice my **CSS Grid** knowledge. This technology is awesome, and therefore may be overused in this project.
